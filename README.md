FreshUbuntuInstall
==================

Run this command to customize a Fresh 14.04 LTS.

WARNING: This script will download and install a **very** large amount of data. >=3,5 GB

Note:

1. You'll need to be in the sudoers file to run this command.
1. Put the .fvwm folder and .Xresources file in the user's home directory.
1. I removed the .fvwm/icons folder because I wasn't sure of their origin. I don't want a copyright lawsuit so I deleted them. They're available from IcoMoon.io if you're **that** interested. YMMV
