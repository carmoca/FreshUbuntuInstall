FreshUbuntuInstall
==================

Run this command to customize a Fresh 14.04 LTS.

You'll need to be in the sudoers file to run this command.

Put the .fvwm folder and .Xresources file in the user's home directory.

I removed the .fvwm/icons folder because I wasn't sure of their origin. I don't want a copyright lawsuit so I deleted them. They're available from IcoMoon.io if you're **that** interested. YMMV
